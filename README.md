# Project-F
In this project I will cover my FS-21 courses.


This project's main point is to create a comminication portal for university students in specific areas such as Berlin or any other city. In this pilot project my main area is Berlin. 

Project-F is for students who wants to interact with others to create the perfect network in Berlin.
